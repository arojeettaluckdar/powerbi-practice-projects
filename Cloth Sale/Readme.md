## 1. Project Objective  
The objective of this project is to analyze sales, unsold inventory, pricing, and revenue distribution across different clothing products using Power BI.  

The dashboard answers the following questions:  
1. Which products generate the highest sales and revenue?  
2. Which products have the highest unsold counts?  
3. How does total price distribution compare between Male and Female categories?  
4. What is the impact of a 50% discount on total price?  
5. Which categories contribute more to total revenue?

## 2. Dataset Description  
The dataset (**Cloth Sales.xlsx**) includes the following fields:  
- **sno** â€“ Serial number  
- **product name** â€“ Clothing item (e.g., T-Shirt, Jeans, Kurta, Saree, etc.)  
- **category** â€“ Gender category (Male / Female)  
- **price** â€“ Price per product

- **unsold** â€“ Units unsold

## 3. Approach  
- Imported dataset into Power BI.  
- Generated **total revenue** by multiplying *sold Ã— price*.  
- Applied a **50% discount calculation** to evaluate price reduction impact.  
- Built dashboard visualizations:  
  - **Bar chart** for sales by product  
  - **Bar chart** for unsold products  
  - **Donut chart** for revenue distribution by product  
  - **Bar chart** for revenue by category  
  - **Bar chart** for price distribution by category  
  - **Cards** to highlight discount-adjusted price and total revenue
