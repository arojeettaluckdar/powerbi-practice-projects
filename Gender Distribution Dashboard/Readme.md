## Project Title  
**World Population Forecast (2030â€“2040) â€“ Gender Distribution Dashboard**

---

## 1. Project Objective  
The objective of this project is to explore **world population projections for 2030â€“2040** using Power BI.  
The dashboard answers four analytical questions:  

1. Which countries have the **highest male population**?  
2. What is the **difference between male and female population** in top countries?  
3. Which countries show the **highest total population**?  
4. Which countries have the **lowest female population**?  

---

## 2. Dataset Description  
The dataset represents **projected population data (2030â€“2040)** with the following fields:  

- **Location** â€“ Country/Region name  
- **Year** â€“ Projection year  
- **PopMale** â€“ Male population  
- **PopFemale** â€“ Female population  

ðŸ‘‰ Note: The dataset was used *as-is* without preprocessing or cleaning.

## 3. Approach  
- Imported the dataset into Power BI.  
- Created visuals directly using the provided fields.  
- Used **bar charts, donut chart, and clustered column chart** to answer each classroom question.

## 4. Visualizations & Answers  

1. **Highest Male Population (Bar Chart)**  
   - India and China are projected to have the largest male populations, followed by USA, Indonesia, and Nigeria.  

2. **Difference in Male and Female Population (Clustered Column Chart)**  
   - A clear gender gap exists in India and China with higher male counts.  
   - USA, Indonesia, and Nigeria have smaller gaps.  

3. **Highest Total Population (Donut Chart)**  
   - Tonga, Grenada, Saint Vincent & the Grenadines, and Aruba are shown among the top in the dataset.  

4. **Lowest Female Population (Bar Chart)**  
   - Guam, CuraÃ§ao, and Kiribati show the lowest female population values.  

---

## 5. Insights  
- India and China will continue to dominate global male population counts.  
- Gender differences are projected to be largest in Asiaâ€™s most populous countries.  
- Smaller nations appear prominently due to dataset scale, not necessarily real global share.  
- Certain island nations (e.g., Guam, CuraÃ§ao) are at the lowest female population levels.
